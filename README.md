This site is a satirical parody of another famous social media site with a similar name. 
The goals for this project are the following:
1. Users going to the original site will mis-type and be accidentially routed to this site, where they will be confused and hopefully a bit annoyed
2. Provide some commentary on the exploitative and sometimes creepy nature of that industry.
3. Use this project as a part of my portfolio :)
